# Notice

I am no longer an active user of GitHub and I don't host my projects on here anymore.
My current repositories can be found [on my Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/speedie). I occasionally submit issues and pull requests though. 

If you need to contact me urgently, [email me](mailto:speedie@duck.com).
All information you could want can be found on my website [here](https://speedie.gq).
